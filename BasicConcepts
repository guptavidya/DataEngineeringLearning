Descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics are four types of data analysis that help businesses and organizations make informed decisions. 
Each type of analytics has a unique purpose and contributes to the overall data-driven decision-making process:

Descriptive analytics
Uses historical data to understand what happened in the past. It provides a foundation for contextual insights by examining patterns and events.

Predictive analytics
Uses historical data to identify patterns and generate forecasts about what is likely to happen in the future. It uses advanced modeling techniques to enable proactive decision-making.

Prescriptive analytics
Combines forecasts with mathematical optimization, operations research, and decision sciences to identify the best course of action. It recommends actions that can be taken to affect outcomes.
