Descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics are four types of data analysis that help businesses and organizations make informed decisions. 
Each type of analytics has a unique purpose and contributes to the overall data-driven decision-making process:

Descriptive analytics
Uses historical data to understand what happened in the past. It provides a foundation for contextual insights by examining patterns and events.

Predictive analytics
Uses historical data to identify patterns and generate forecasts about what is likely to happen in the future. It uses advanced modeling techniques to enable proactive decision-making.

Prescriptive analytics
Combines forecasts with mathematical optimization, operations research, and decision sciences to identify the best course of action. 
It recommends actions that can be taken to affect outcomes. 

Data modelling techniques:
Star schema is one of three schemas used in data warehouses to properly organize your data. The other two are snowflake schema and galaxy schema. 
While there are differences between the three, they all share a similarity in that they all promote fast and efficient querying of large data sets.

A star schema model always has only one central "fact table" which is surrounded by multiple dimension tables; this is a defining characteristic of the star schema design. 
Key points about the star schema:

    Single fact table:
    The core of a star schema is a single fact table that holds the primary data points or metrics.
    Dimension tables:
    Multiple dimension tables are connected to the fact table, providing descriptive context about the data in the fact table.


Star schemas have several disadvantages, including:

Data redundancy: Star schemas use data denormalization, which can lead to multiple copies of the same data. This redundancy requires more storage space and increases costs. 
Data quality: Star schemas don't enforce data integrity, which can impact data quality. 
Maintenance: Denormalized dimension tables can be difficult to maintain because updates may require changes in multiple places. 
Complex queries: Star schemas can make it harder to run more complex queries. 
Limited flexibility: Star schemas are less robust than normalized structures and may not be able to capture complex relationships between dimensions. 
Data loading time: Star schemas may have increased data loading time due to additional columns for foreign keys. 
Query performance: Multiple joins between tables can result in slower query performance
